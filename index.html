            <h2> Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li> 300 g (about 30) Savoiardi Ladyfingers.</li>
                <li> 500 g (1,1 lb = 2 1/4 cups) of mascarpone cheese.</li>
                <li> 4 medium eggs</li>
                <li> 100 g (1/2 cup) of granulated sugar</li>
                <li> 300 ml (1 Â¼ cup) of coffee</li>
                <li> 2 tablespoons of Rum or Marsala</li>
                <li> unsweetened cocoa powder</li>
            </ul>
            <p> To make this fabulous Italian dessert you need a ceramic baking pan. For 8 people you need one of about 30 x 19 cm (12 x 8 inch), like the one we used in this recipe. There are several types but have a look at this set of Ceramic Baking Dish. They are perfect casseroles even for lasagna.<br> You absolutely need an electric stand mixer that really is a great help for making a perfect tiramisu. We opted for the KitchenAid Artisan Series 5 Quart Stand Mixer but there are other very good brands. For example, another excellent and less expensive stand mixer is this 5.5-Quart Stand Mixer by Cuisinart.</p>
